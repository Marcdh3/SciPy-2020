    "Perturbations of organellar structures within a cell are useful indicators of the cellâ€™s response to viral or bacterial invaders. Of the various organelles, mitochondria are meaningful to model because they show distinct migration patterns in the presence of potentially fatal infections, such as tuberculosis. Properly modeling and assessing mitochondria could provide new information about infections that can be leveraged to develop tests, treatments, and vaccines. Traditionally, mitochondrial structures have been assessed via manual inspection of fluorescent microscopy imagery. However, manual microscopy studies are labor-intensive and fail to provide a high-throughput for screenings. Thus, demonstrating the need for techniques that are more automated and utilize quantitative metrics for analysis. Yet, modeling mitochondria is no trivial task; mitochondria are amorphous, spatially diffuse structures that render traditional shape-based, parametric modeling techniques ineffective. We address the modeling task by using OrNet (Organellar Networks), a Python framework that utilizes probabilistic, graph-theoretic techniques to cast mitochondrial dynamics in the mold of dynamic social networks. We propose quantitative temporal and spatial anomaly detection techniques that leverage the graph connectivity information of the social networks to reveal time points of anomalous behavior and spatial regions where organellar structures undergo significant morphological changes related to a relevant change in environment or stimulus. We demonstrate the advantages of these techniques with the results of exhaustive graph-theoretic analyses over time in three different mitochondrial conditions. This methodology provides the quantification, visualization, and analysis techniques necessary for rigorous spatiotemporal modeling of diffuse organelles.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This poster will serve as an interactive guide to explore the temporal and spatial anomaly detection methodologies utilized in our framework, OrNet, to assess mitochondrial dynamics. First we will present a brief overview of the entire framework, then describe ways to run each stage in the pipeline individually or the entire pipeline in an end-to-end manner or with code examples. \n",

    "## Mitochondrial Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitochondria are amorphous, spatially diffuse structures whose morphology exists within a dynamic continuum, ranging from fragmented individual mitochondrion to complex interconnected networks. The morphology of mitochondria transitions between many states along its spectrum, as a result of fission and fusion events, and the observation of these morphological changes is referred to as mitochondrial dynamics. Traditionally, analysis of mitochondrial dynamics was accomplished via manual inspection of microscopy imagery. However, manual approaches are labor-intensive, and are unscalable in terms of processing large volumes of data. Thus, we seek to elucidate mitochondrial dynamics by providing quantitative methodologies to measure spatial and temporal regions of anomalous morphological behavior in an automated manner via spectral analysis of dynamic social networks.\n",

    "We have provided live HeLa cell microscopy videos [here](https://github.com/Marcdh3/SciPy-2020/tree/master/samples) to test our techniques. The data is organized into three sub-directories that corresponds to the three different cell types we utilized in our experiments: control, llo, and mdivi. Control refers to the group of cells that were not exposed to any external stimulant; llo refers to the group that was exposed to listeriolysin O (llo), a pore-forming toxin, to induce mitochondrial fragmentation; and mdivi refers to the group that was exposed to mitochondrial-division inhibitor 1 (mdivi) to induce mitochondrial fusion. In all of the subsequent code examples we utilize the llo.mp4 microscopy video, however, we encourage everyone to test our techniques using the other videos as well.\n",

Mitochondria are spatially diffuse structures that occupy a vast amount of the cell and, as a result, many areas of the cell require detailed inspection to identify all significant spatial changes. However, many structural perturbations go unnoticed when evaluated with purely qualitative metrics because of the large search space and the inherent difficulty in tracking microscopic objects. Thus, we sought to provide a quantitative technique to indicate spatial regions demonstrating anomalous morphological behavior.\n",

The process of tracking such regions is, in essence, an object detection task because specific mitochondrial clusters are being monitored as the global structure evolves over time. By treating this task as such, we utilized bounding boxes to highlight the regions of significance. The coordinates of the bounding boxes were computed based on the pixel coordinates denoted by the GMMs that corresponded to the spatial locations of the mitochondrial clusters. Therefore, a bounding box can be displayed for each mitochondrial cluster determined by the GMM. \n",

    "This poster served an interactive way to explore the functionality of OrNet, and utilize it to understand mitochondrial dynamics. We ultimately hope to use the proposed spatiotemporal analsysis techniques and the OrNet software package to conduct large-scale genomic screens of bacterial and viral mutants, in an effort to build a deeper understanding of how these pathogens invade cells and induce cell death at the genetic level. This work is one of the first steps toward that ultimate goal."
