    "Perturbations of organellar structures within a cell are useful indicators of the cellâ€™s response to viral or bacterial invaders. Of the various organelles, mitochondria are meaningful to model because they show distinct migration patterns in the presence of potentially fatal infections, such as tuberculosis. Properly modeling and assessing mitochondria could provide new information about infections that can be leveraged to develop tests, treatments, and vaccines. Traditionally, mitochondrial structures have been assessed via manual inspection of fluorescent microscopy imagery. However, manual microscopy studies are labor-intensive and fail to provide a high-throughput for screenings. Thus, demonstrating the need for techniques that are more automated and utilize quantitative metrics for analysis. Yet, modeling mitochondria is no trivial task; mitochondria are amorphous, spatially diffuse structures that render traditional shape-based, parametric modeling techniques ineffective. We address the modeling task by using OrNet (Organellar Networks), a Python framework that utilizes probabilistic, graph-theoretic techniques to cast mitochondrial dynamics in the mold of dynamic social networks. We propose quantitative temporal and spatial anomaly detection techniques that leverage the graph connectivity information of the social networks to reveal time points of anomalous behavior and spatial regions where organellar structures undergo significant morphological changes related to a relevant change in environment or stimulus. We demonstrate the advantages of these techniques with the results of exhaustive graph-theoretic analyses over time in three different mitochondrial conditions. This methodology provides the quantification, visualization, and analysis techniques necessary for rigorous spatiotemporal modeling of diffuse organelles.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This poster will serve as an in-depth guide to explore the temporal and spatial anomaly detection methodologies utilized in our framework, OrNet, to assess mitochondrial dynamics. First we will present a brief overview of the entire framework, then describe ways to run the entire pipeline in an end-to-end manner or each stage individually with code examples.\n",

    "## Mitochondrial Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitochondria are amorphous, spatially diffuse structures whose morphology exists within a dynamic continuum, ranging from fragmented individual mitochondrion to complex interconnected networks. The morphology of mitochondria transitions between many states along its spectrum, as a result of fission and fusion events, and the observation of these morphological changes is referred to as mitochondrial dynamics. Traditionally, analysis of mitochondrial dynamics was accomplished via manual inspection of microscopy imagery. However, manual approaches are labor-intensive, and are unscalable in terms of processing large volumes of data. Thus, we seek to elucidate mitochondrial dynamics by providing quantitative methodologies to measure spatial and temporal regions of anomalous morphological behavior in an automated manner via spectral analysis of dynamic social networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have provided live HeLa cell microscopy videos [here](https://github.com/Marcdh3/SciPy-2020/tree/master/samples) to test our techniques. The data is organized into three sub-directories that corresponds to the three different cell types we utilized in our experiments: control, llo, and mdivi. Control refers to the group of cells that were not exposed to any external stimulant; llo refers to the group that was exposed to listeriolysin O (llo), a pore-forming toxin, to induce mitochondrial fragmentation; and mdivi refers to the group that was exposed to mitochondrial-division inhibitor 1 (mdivi) to induce mitochondrial fusion. In all of the subsequent code examples we utilize ---, however, we encourage everyone to test our techniques using the other videos as well.\n",

    "## OrNet Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[OrNet](https://github.com/quinngroup/ornet) is a Python framework that models the spatiotemporal relationships of subcellular organelles as dynamic social networks. In this context, a dynamic social network is a series of evolving graphs that captures the morphological state of an organelle at discrete points in time. We utilized OrNet to construct dynamic social networks of fluorescently tagged mitochondria in live microscopy videos so that we could leverage spectral graph theory techniques to perform temporal and anomaly detection. Below is an outline of OrNet's pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "Truncates video frames after a specified number. We performed this step in our experiments because in most of our microscopy videos the mitochondria within the cells stopped demonstrating morphological changes after a specific number of frames. However, if signifiant spatial events occur the entire duration of the video, this step can be avoided. For our experiments, we constrained the videos to a maximum of 20,000 frames.\n",

    "\n",
    "In most cases, live micrscopy videos contain multiple cells. However, our methodology consists of making dynamic social networks of an organelle contained within **one** cell, so we segment out each individual cell into its own video to mitigate the chances of constructing graphs with unlikely biological connections (e.g. inter-cellular connections between mitochondrial clusters), in the context of assessing organellar peturbations in response to cellular invaders. If the live microscopy video being processed only contains one cell, then this step can be skipped.\n",
